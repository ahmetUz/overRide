In this program, the vulnerability we will exploit is in the printf function.
```c
printf(&var);
```
which will allow us to read from the stack, considering that the flag is also located in the stack.

```c
FILE* rax = fopen("/home/users/level03/.pass", &data_400bb0);
    if (rax == 0)
    {
        fwrite("ERROR: failed to open password fâ€¦", 1, 0x24, stderr);
        exit(1);
        /* no return */
    }
    int32_t rax_1 = fread(&var_a8, 1, 0x29, rax);
```

```asm
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000400814 <+0>:     push   %rbp
   0x0000000000400815 <+1>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000000400818 <+4>:     sub    $0x120,%rsp
```

Therefore, knowing that my stack has a size of 0x120 (288) and that we are in 64 bits, we know that the flag will be within the range of 0-36.

```

We can see that from 22 to 26, we have a sequence of elements, and our flags consist of 40 bytes (5 * 8). It's convenient since we have a sequence of 5.
Knowing that we are in little endian, if we convert it to ASCII, we retrieve our flag.
